This plugin provides the header links, footer links, and a "skip navigation" link (for accessibility) required for AgriLife websites using Genesis child themes (excluding AgriFlex3).

To install dependencies:
1. Open the command line and navigate to this repo's directory
2. Type "npm run once" and press enter

That's it! The SASS file will compile to CSS every time it is saved.

To watch your SASS, follow the steps above but for Step 2 type "npm run watch" instead.
